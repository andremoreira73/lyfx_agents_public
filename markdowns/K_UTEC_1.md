# Summary: Scoping Study for Comprehensive Utilisation of Seabittern in Pilbara, Australia

## Introduction
The Scoping Study conducted by **K-UTEC AG Salt Technologies** for **BCI Minerals Limited** evaluates the technical and economic viability of utilizing **bittern**, a by-product of the Mardie Salt Project in Western Australia. Traditionally discharged into the ocean, bittern contains valuable components like **potassium sulphate (SOP)**, **potassium chloride (MOP)**, magnesium salts, and bromine. The study focuses on SOP production through three process variants and assesses by-product recovery to enhance economic and ecological outcomes.

## Project Site and Conditions

### Location
The project site, located in the Pilbara region, spans **832 km²** of granted and pending exploration licenses. The area benefits from **existing infrastructure** including highways, ports, and a gas pipeline.

### Climate
The site features an **arid desert climate (BWh)** with **annual evaporation (3,248 mm)** exceeding precipitation (278 mm), making it ideal for solar salt production. Cyclones and flooding pose potential risks, which must be mitigated during plant design.

### Environmental and Social Considerations
Key concerns include impacts on **mangroves, marine parks**, and surface hydrology. Native Title Agreements with the **Kuruma Marthudunera** and **Yaburara & Coastal Mardudhunera** groups allow for mining and infrastructure development, with provisions for pre-production and ongoing payments.

## NaCl Process and Bittern Utilisation

### Overview
Bittern, a by-product of NaCl crystallization, is processed to produce **SOP** and by-products. Three SOP production variants include:
- **Conversion Process (A):** NaCl removed by dissolution.
- **Hot Leaching Process (B):** NaCl separated through heat and cooling crystallization.
- **Flotation Process (C):** NaCl removed via flotation.

### By-products
Valuable by-products include **bromine**, **epsomite (MgSO₄·7H₂O)**, **bischofite (MgCl₂·6H₂O)**, and **magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂)**.

## Process Design and Outputs

### Pond and Plant Design
The process involves:
- **Area 100:** Solar evaporation ponds for NaCl, pre-KTMS, and KTMS.
- **Area 200:** SOP plant converting KTMS and carnallite into SOP.
- **Areas 300–600:** Facilities for bromine extraction, brine desulphurization, and magnesium product recovery.

### Outputs
Estimated annual production includes:
- **SOP:** ~116 kt (Variant A).
- **By-products:** Bromine (~10.3 kt), Mg(OH)₂ (~23 kt), and raw bischofite (~1,115 kt).

## Economic Assessment

### CAPEX
The capital expenditure for the SOP route is estimated at **€183M–€189M**, depending on the variant. Costs include equipment, infrastructure, and contingencies.

### OPEX
Annual operational costs are projected at:
- **Variant A:** €82M.
- **Variant B:** €91.5M.
- **Variant C:** €83M.

Expenses cover electricity, water, natural gas, and labor, excluding waste management and environmental compliance.

---

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The study identifies the **SOP route** as the preferred option due to higher product value and compatibility with by-product recovery. **Variant A** is the most cost-effective for SOP production, while **Variants B** and **C** offer potential technical advantages. Key recommendations include:
- Further **environmental impact assessments**.
- Market analysis for by-products.
- Optimizing **energy efficiency** in the process.
