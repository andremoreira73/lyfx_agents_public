# Summary of the Latest Hydrogen News
(15-21.11.2024)

The recent developments in the hydrogen sector reveal global momentum toward clean energy transitions, with notable initiatives, challenges, and policy discussions spanning various regions.

## Italy's National Hydrogen Strategy
The Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (MASE) will present its National Hydrogen Strategy on November 26, marking a significant milestone in the country’s decarbonization journey. This event will feature Minister Gilberto Pichetto and GSE President Paolo Arrigoni, emphasizing hydrogen’s pivotal role in Italy's energy transition and the opportunities and challenges inherent in its implementation.

## European Union (EU) Highlights
Policy and Parliamentary Developments
Carbon Removals Certification Framework
The European Council approved a certification framework for carbon removals to support the EU's net-zero emissions goal by 2050. This regulation includes technologies such as direct air capture and carbon storage, with compliance mechanisms and a registry set for implementation.

Romania's Renewable Energy Aid Scheme:
The EU has approved a €578 million aid scheme for Romania to promote renewable energy use among energy-intensive industries. Conditions include using carbon-free electricity and implementing energy audits.

Hydrogen Infrastructure Importance:
A report from the European Gas Industry Association (GIE) emphasizes hydrogen infrastructure as vital to the EU’s climate goals. However, ACER’s monitoring report warns of missed 2030 targets for renewable hydrogen, citing demand uncertainties and cost barriers.

EU-Mercosur Agreement:
The EU’s potential trade agreement with Mercosur countries aims to diversify critical mineral sourcing for hydrogen technologies, reducing reliance on China. This agreement could bolster green hydrogen production but faces opposition from environmental groups and industry stakeholders.

Innovations and Financing:
European Hydrogen Bank Auctions
The European Hydrogen Bank announced an "Auctions-as-a-Service" program, mobilizing €2 billion to fund renewable hydrogen projects across member states. This aligns with the EU's broader REPowerEU and Green Deal strategies.

EIB Loans for Green Technologies:
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved loans to Spain’s Iberdrola (€500 million) for smart grids and Poland’s ORLEN Group to integrate renewable energy under the REPowerEU initiative.

Hydrogen Week and Protests:
Hydrogen Week in Brussels showcased the EU's ambitious hydrogen plans, including producing and importing 20 million tons by 2030. However, activists criticized the event for legitimizing fossil fuel interests under the guise of clean hydrogen promotion.

## International Highlights

United States:
The Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub secured $1.2 billion in funding but faces uncertainty due to unresolved tax credit policies. Industry leaders urged regulatory clarity to ensure progress in hydrogen projects.

South Africa:
At a parliamentary briefing, Minister Parks Tau emphasized South Africa’s Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy as a cornerstone for economic growth and emission reduction.

Norway and India Cooperation:
India and Norway strengthened ties on renewable energy and green hydrogen, discussing investment opportunities to foster innovation and research collaboration.

## Technological and Industrial Developments

Hydrogen-Powered Cargo Ships:
The EU’s Innovation Fund awarded €40 million to Energy Observer for the EO2, the largest liquid hydrogen-powered cargo ship, expected to cut CO₂ emissions by over 112,000 tons in 10 years.

Germany’s Fuel Cell Trucks:
Germany allocated €226 million to develop 100 fuel cell trucks, advancing the hydrogen value chain and promoting sustainable road freight.

Aviation and Hydrogen:
EU discussions explored integrating hydrogen into Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), calling for regulatory revisions to expand SAF feedstock definitions.

Global Commitments:
At COP29, a Hydrogen Declaration was launched to accelerate low-carbon hydrogen adoption and global standards. Additionally, a pledge to phase out unabated coal plants reflects the growing international alignment on clean energy transitions.

Challenges and Criticism

Despite progress, the EU faces significant hurdles:

Regulatory and Market Barriers
Fragmented national policies and high hydrogen production costs impede investment and deployment.

Activist Criticism
Concerns over fossil fuel ties in hydrogen projects and the environmental impact of certain initiatives were prominent during protests.

## Looking Ahead
With mounting investments, global collaborations, and regulatory advancements, hydrogen is cementing its role in the energy transition. However, balancing economic realities with ambitious climate goals remains a critical challenge for policymakers worldwide.
